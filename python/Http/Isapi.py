"""Global ISAPI request handler.

All requests go here - after the first successful
import of this module & Request() function, it
will not be reloaded for the life of the interpreter.

This default simply attempts to load the file targeted
by the URL and call its Request() function. Although
SCRIPT_TRANSLATED is not available in IIS 5.x, it is
emulated for completeness.

I don't really recommend this method - it's not as
package/module oriented as the Regex and Advanced
examples, which can handle arbitrary URLs and pass
them to preloaded handlers.

ALSO: imp.load_source is NOT case-sensitive and doesn't
follow the typical import case rules. You might like this
but it's really not great behavior.

See example Isapi.py files in ../Examples, including
one that makes this version backwards compatible with
v1.0.0 (in the Compat folder).
