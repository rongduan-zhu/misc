"""Global ISAPI request handler for use with WSGI applications.

This example merges two WSGI applications and also runs scripts
directly.

If you don't have either Django or Trac, comment out that section
and the entry in "Apps" and it should work fine.

You may also believe that you can run multiple Django projects just
by choosing the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable based
on the URL, but beware- that is a process-level value you're
changing! I'm not sure if the value is also looked for in the WSGI
environment. For now, I'm just leaving it at one project.

I chose to place the root folder under /app for the specific
purpose of making PyISAPIe the wildcard handler for that path only.
For IIS 5.x, all the paths must end in ".py" because an extension
must be associated with a handler.

See the install docs for further information, and the WSGI setup
page for specifics about getting this script going.
