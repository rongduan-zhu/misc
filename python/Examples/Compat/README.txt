This example provides backwards compatibility with version 1.0.0.
There is one minor difference - __target__ will be prepended
with '\\?\' to represent a string that is able to be longer than
MAX_PATH - this was cut out in 1.0.0. You can remove this difference
by cutting it out within the initialization of the main request
handler.
